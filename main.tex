\subsection{Repository Initialization and Commits}
First, I created a repository on my GitHub account. Then, I navigated to the Actions tab and selected the option to create a custom action. I pasted the main.yml file into the editor and committed the changes. After that, I cloned my repository to a local folder on my PC and started writing the content.

\subsection{GitHub Actions for LaTeX Compilation}
In this part, I created a file that compiles LaTeX to PDF with some prompts. To compile the LaTeX file, we need to create a tag using the git tag command, which allows the document to be published as a PDF on GitHub.
